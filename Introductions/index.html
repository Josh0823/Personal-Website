            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello everyone, my name is Josh Geden and I am member of the Duke's Class of 2023. I am studying Computer Science and Linguistics. I was born and raised in Greenville, SC.</p>

                <p>This website is being created as my first project for Duke's

            <h2>Computer Science Autobiography</h2>
                <p>My earliest memories of a computer are playing online games on my family's early 2000s desktop as a child. I became interested in Computer Science starting in middle school which is when I designed my first website, but it wasn't until high school when I took my first CS course that it became a passion of mine.</p>
                <p>My first programming langauge was Java and it is still the language I am most comfortable in, but I have dabbled in almost all the major programming languages, including Python, C, C++, Ruby, Scheme, and Javascript. I have not used programming on any major projects outside of school yet, but I use Python scripts fairly often to edit game files for certain video games I like and for doing math homework.</p>
                <p>In the future I hope to work in AI and NLP, but I also am interested in general software engineering. Through this course I hope to gain more pratical development experience and expand my portfolio. On a daily basis, I think web developers most likely hunt for bugs and work on either optimization or slight style improvements, depending on whether they focus on front-end or back-end development. Full-stack website design probably demands the most well rounded skillset of any development environment. In order to be a full-stack developer you need to understand front-end design and user-interface design using Javascript or PHP and back-end and server design using a serverside language such as Python, Java, or Ruby.</p>
